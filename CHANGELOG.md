# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are recorded here. Versions follow
[semver](https://semver.org/); each one is released from a `v`-prefixed tag such as `v0.1.0`.

## [0.1.1] - Unreleased

### Fixed

- Saving a comment in the viewer no longer reloads the page, so the open comment, the picked
  component and the scroll position stay put. `prototypeLab()` now keeps the prototypes folder's
  `annotations.json` files out of Vite's watcher itself, alongside anything the project's own
  `server.watch.ignored` lists; a project config no longer needs to set this. Screen files stay
  watched.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

First release as a standalone package, moved out of Vinta's Building Blocks monorepo with its
history.

### Added

- `prototype-lab` CLI: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, and `install-skill`.
- `vinta-prototype-lab/vite`: the `prototypeLab()` Vite plugin, for a `prototype-lab.config.ts` or
  any Vite config. Options: `dir`, `css`, `storybook`, `title`, `root`, `react`, `tailwind`.
- `mountViewer()`, which starts the viewer over a set of prototype files.
- The `build-prototype` agent skill, installable with `prototype-lab install-skill` or
  `npx skills add vintasoftware/vinta-prototype-lab`.
- `vinta-prototype-lab/theme.css` and `vinta-prototype-lab/default.css`: the shadcn/ui theme, and the
  Tailwind stylesheet screens get when the project names none.
- Group folders under `prototypes/`: a prototype can sit in `prototypes/billing/refunds/`, and its
  slug and links take the whole path. The header's prototype picker is now a searchable list with
  a heading for each group.

### Changed

- The viewer's chrome ships as compiled CSS and uses vendored shadcn/ui components, so it depends on
  no Vinta design-system package.
- Storybook linking is configurable: its URL, an optional marker section to recognise the project's
  Storybook by, or `false` to turn it off.
